# ViT Inference Pipeline Optimization: Research Questions and Experimental Design

## Abstract

This research investigates the optimization of Vision Transformer (ViT) inference pipelines with significant host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) data transfer overhead. We systematically analyze how model architectural parameters, hardware configurations, compilation strategies, and memory locality optimizations affect end-to-end inference performance, with a primary focus on maximizing throughput while maintaining practical latency constraints.

## Goal

Train a Large Vision Model on Clean LCLS diffraction/scattering images.

## Challenges

**Images consist of at least megapixel**

**Images are captured on different detectors**

**Techniques of capturing images vary significantly**

**What tasks should we use to validate this foundation model?**

## Tasks

What technique is likely used to capture this image?
